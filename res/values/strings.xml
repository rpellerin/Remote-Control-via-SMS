	    data (only for versions of Android below 5.0) and wifi settings remotely, to produce a loud beep, or to receive the current GPS location of your phone. That can be
	    done on receiving specific SMS that you\'ll determine. You can also send a SMS to some people automatically, in case of emergency. All the settings are accessible via the menu on the left.</string>
